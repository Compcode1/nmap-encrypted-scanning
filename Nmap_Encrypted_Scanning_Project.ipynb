    "**Objective**\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of this scenario was to establish a baseline for how Nmap detects open, unencrypted services. To achieve this, an HTTP server without encryption was set up on the MacBook Air, and an Nmap scan was conducted from the Dell Windows 11 system to analyze what services and ports were detected before implementing encryption in later scenarios.\n",
    "\n",
    "Steps Taken\n",
    "Set up a Python HTTP server on the MacBook Air:\n",
    "\n",
    "The following command was executed in the MacBook‚Äôs Terminal:\n",
    "\n",
    "sudo python3 -m http.server 80 --bind 0.0.0.0\n",
    "\n",
    "This command launched an unencrypted web server on port 80, making it accessible over the local network.\n",
    "\n",
    "Verified the MacBook‚Äôs IP address:\n",
    "\n",
    "The command below was used to identify the local IP address of the MacBook Air:\n",
    "\n",
    "ifconfig | grep \"inet \"\n",
    "\n",
    "The system returned an IP address of 192.168.1.148, confirming that the device was reachable on the network.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tested HTTP access from the Dell system:\n",
    "\n",
    "Using Google Chrome on the Dell Windows 11 system, the following URL was entered:\n",
    "\n",
    "http://192.168.1.148\n",
    "\n",
    "The browser successfully loaded the server‚Äôs directory listing, confirming that the HTTP server was functional and accessible.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Performed Nmap scans from the Dell system:**\n",
    "Basic port scan **(nmap 192.168.1.148)**) is executed to detect open ports.\n",
    "Service version detection scan **(nmap -sV 192.168.1.148)** was performed to identify running services.\n",
    "Aggressive scan **(nmap -A 192.168.1.148)** was conducted for more detailed fingerprinting.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Findings from the Baseline Scan**\n",
    "Key Findings:\n",
    "Port 80 (HTTP) was detected as open, confirming that the unencrypted Python HTTP server was active and accessible.\n",
    "Nmap identified the service as SimpleHTTPServer 0.6 (Python 3.12.3), which aligns with the expected output for Python's built-in web server.\n",
    "The OS fingerprinting results correctly identified the target machine as running macOS (versions 11-13).\n",
    "A directory listing was detected on the HTTP server, meaning that any files in the directory where the server was launched were openly accessible.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Additional Interesting Observations:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Port 5000/tcp & 7000/tcp were open, running AirTunes RTSP (Real Time Streaming Protocol) services (rtspd 775.3.1). These are used by Apple‚Äôs AirPlay for media streaming.\n",
    "Port 49152/tcp was open but unidentified. This is a common ephemeral port that macOS may use for internal communication or background services.\n",
    "Nmap detected a .git directory on the HTTP server, which could indicate an exposed Git repository if it were publicly accessible.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Conclusion:**\n",
    "The baseline Nmap scan was successfully completed, providing a clear view of how Nmap detects unencrypted services on a network. Port 80 was correctly identified, and additional open ports (such as AirTunes services) were also detected. This establishes a reference point for comparison in future scenarios when encryption is applied.\n",
    "\n",
    "üìå Scenario 1: Summary of the Flow (Baseline - Unencrypted HTTP)\n",
    "Step 1: The Mac starts an unencrypted HTTP server on 0.0.0.0:80, making it accessible to any device on the network.\n",
    "Step 2: The Dell scans 192.168.1.148:80 and detects an open HTTP service.\n",
    "Step 3: The Dell accesses http://192.168.1.148 in a browser, confirming the connection is unencrypted.\n",
    "Step 4: Nmap‚Äôs aggressive scan (-A) reveals a directory listing, meaning files on the server are openly accessible.\n",
    "\n",
    "üöÄ Key Takeaway\n",
    "üîπ All traffic is unencrypted, meaning data can be intercepted.\n",
    "üîπ Nmap detects HTTP on port 80, confirming the service is running with no encryption.\n",
    "üîπ The server allows directory listing, which could expose sensitive files to attackers.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Next Steps: Implementing TLS Encryption**\n",
    "\n",
    "With the baseline scan complete, the next step is to encrypt the HTTP traffic using TLS (HTTPS) and analyze how Nmap‚Äôs detection results change. This will involve:\n",
    "\n",
    "Setting up an HTTPS server on the MacBook Air with a self-signed TLS certificate.\n",
    "Running the same Nmap scans from the Dell system to compare results.\n",

    "The certificate is self-signed, which means it is not trusted by default browsers, resulting in a security warning. However, the encryption itself is functional.\n",
    "\n",
    "**üö® Security Concern: Exposed .git Directory**\n",
    "\n",
    "The .git directory could potentially leak sensitive repository information.\n",
    "This was not detected in Scenario 1 (HTTP) but was found in Scenario 2 (HTTPS).\n",
    "Possible reasons it was detected now:\n",
    "Nmap's HTTP scripts scanned more deeply over HTTPS.\n",
    "Additional web security measures on HTTP may have blocked certain requests.\n",
    "The .git folder was manually added or became exposed during the transition to HTTPS.\n",

    "**Potential risk:**\n",
    "If this Git repository contains sensitive credentials, API keys, or proprietary code, an attacker could clone it remotely.\n",
    "If the .git folder is publicly accessible, attackers could extract commit history and config files.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Recommendation:**\n",
    "Restrict access to the .git directory in the web server configuration.\n",
    "Ensure no sensitive credentials are stored in Git repositories accessible from the web root.\n",
    "Verify that Git is not exposing unwanted files using ls -la /path/to/webroot/.git.\n",

    "**üîπ Additional Insight: Understanding Cipher Suite Negotiation**  \n",
    "\n",
    "In our analysis, we determined that the HTTPS server **supports** strong encryption methods, but Nmap does not tell us which cipher suite is actually **negotiated and used** in a real connection.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**üîπ Key Clarification:**  \n",
    "- Nmap lists **all available cipher suites** that the server supports.  \n",
    "- The **actual cipher chosen depends on handshake negotiation** between the client and server.  \n",
    "- If a client does not support the strongest cipher, a weaker one may be selected.  \n",
    "- **Nmap does not simulate a full TLS handshake**, so we cannot see the final choice.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**üîπ Optimally, the server will use:**  \n",
    "- **TLS Handshake:** ECDHE for key exchange (supports Perfect Forward Secrecy).  \n",
    "- **Server Authentication:** RSA to verify the certificate.  \n",
    "- **Data Encryption:** AES-256 in GCM mode for confidentiality.  \n",
    "- **Integrity Check:** SHA-384 for message authentication.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**üîπ However, these may be downgraded based on:**  \n",
    "- The client‚Äôs supported ciphers.  \n",
    "- TLS handshake negotiation.  \n",
    "- Server preference settings.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**üîπ How to Determine the Actual Cipher Used?**  \n",
    "To confirm which cipher suite was actually chosen in a real connection, we would need to:  \n",
    "\n",
    "1Ô∏è‚É£ **Perform a live TLS handshake using OpenSSL:**  \n",
    "   ```sh\n",
    "   openssl s_client -connect 192.168.1.148:443\n",

    "**üöÄ Summary:** \n",
    "\n",
    "Nmap shows what is available, but not what is actually used.\n",

    "**Summary of the Flow**\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 1: The Mac starts an HTTP server on 127.0.0.1:8080, but it‚Äôs only accessible from the Mac itself.\n",
    "Step 2: The Dell creates an SSH tunnel (9999 ‚Üí 8080), allowing traffic sent to 127.0.0.1:9999 to be forwarded to 127.0.0.1:8080 (Mac).\n",
    "Step 3: The Dell accesses 127.0.0.1:9999, and traffic is automatically encrypted, sent to the Mac, decrypted, and processed by the HTTP server.\n",
    "Step 4: Nmap scans 127.0.0.1:9999 on the Dell, sees HTTP running, but does not know that it‚Äôs actually coming from the Mac.\n",
    "\n",
    "üöÄ Key Takeaway\n",
    "üîπ The SSH tunnel tricks the Dell into thinking the Mac‚Äôs HTTP server is running locally.\n",
    "üîπ Nmap sees HTTP on 127.0.0.1:9999, but that‚Äôs just the tunnel exposing it‚Äîit doesn‚Äôt detect encryption.\n",
    "üîπ If we ran Wireshark, we would see encrypted SSH traffic between the Dell and Mac (port 22), but unencrypted HTTP on 127.0.0.1:9999.\n",

    "**Final Summary & Key Takeaways**\n",
    "\n",
    " SSH Tunnel Successfully Established\n",
    "\n",
    "HTTP traffic was secured via an SSH tunnel, replacing direct HTTP or HTTPS.\n",
    "Port 9999 correctly forwarded traffic from 127.0.0.1:8080.\n",
    "Nmap successfully scanned HTTP through the SSH tunnel, proving that encrypted tunneling does not inherently block service fingerprinting.\n",
    " Encrypted tunneling prevents third-party network-based packet capture, but does not block service fingerprinting at the local endpoint because decryption happens before the service is accessed. This means that while tunneling protects data in transit from external interception, it does not hide the true nature of a service from an attacker who gains access to the endpoint. In cybersecurity, this reinforces the need for strong endpoint security, access controls, and logging, as attackers who breach a local system can still enumerate services even if traffic was encrypted over the network.\n",

    "**üö® Security Concern: Exposed .git Directory**\n",
    "\n",
    "The .git directory was detected, just as in Scenario 1 (HTTP) and Scenario 2 (HTTPS).\n",
    "This means SSH tunneling does NOT prevent data leaks‚Äîit only encrypts traffic.\n",
    "Recommendation: Restrict access to .git via .htaccess or server configuration.\n",
    "\n",
    "**üõ†Ô∏è Key Differences Compared to Previous Scenarios**\n",
    "\n",
    "Scenario 1: Direct HTTP\n",
    "Connection Type: Unencrypted HTTP.\n",
    "Port Scanned: 80.\n",
    "Encryption Used: ‚ùå None.\n",
    "Key Findings: .git directory exposed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Scenario 2: Direct HTTPS\n",
    "Connection Type: Encrypted HTTPS.\n",
    "Port Scanned: 443.\n",
    "Encryption Used: ‚úÖ TLS 1.2 / 1.3.\n",
    "Key Findings: .git directory still exposed.\n",
    "\n",
    "We are confident that TLS 1.2 and TLS 1.3 were the only versions available on the server because Nmap‚Äôs ssl-enum-ciphers script explicitly confirmed that only these versions were supported. While we previously discussed how individual cryptographic components‚Äîsuch as key exchange (ECDHE), authentication (RSA), encryption (AES-GCM), and integrity verification (SHA-384)‚Äîcould be downgraded based on client-server negotiation, TLS version enforcement operates differently. A server will only allow connections using the versions it supports, meaning if an older version like TLS 1.1 were required by the client, the connection would simply fail rather than downgrade. In our case, the Mac server only advertised TLS 1.2 and 1.3, ensuring that no older, weaker versions could be used. While cipher selection was flexible within the constraints of TLS 1.2/1.3, the protocol version itself was strictly limited by the server‚Äôs configuration, meaning we can be fully confident that one of these two versions was used.\n",
    "\n",
    "Scenario 3: HTTP Over SSH Tunnel\n",
    "Connection Type: HTTP tunneled over SSH.\n",
    "Port Scanned: 9999.\n",
    "Encryption Used: ‚úÖ SSH Tunnel.\n",
    "Key Findings: .git directory still exposed, proving tunneling does not hide services.\n"
